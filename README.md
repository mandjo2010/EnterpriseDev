Django is a powerful framework but choosing the right add-ons that match the scale and scope of your enterprise projects can be tricky. This book will explore the multifarious options available for enterprise Django development. Countless organizations are already using Django and more are migrating to it, unleashing the power of Python with many different packages.
This practical guide will help you understand practices, blueprints, and decision-making tactics to put Django to work the way you need it. You'll learn various ways in which data can be rendered onto a page and discover the power of Django for large-scale production applications. Starting with the basics of getting an enterprise project up and running, you'll get to grips with maintaining the project throughout its lifecycle while learning what the Django application lifecycle is.
This book covers examples in Windows to give you a feel of working with tools such as Visual Studio that effectively manage large-scale Django applications. However, you'll be able to use this book working on a Mac or Linux system too, providing you with suggested tools and commands to work with each exercise on every major platform.
